## üîß Maintaining the Extension

Websites change over time. If the extension stops working, it's almost certainly because Google has updated the CSS class names or HTML structure of the NotebookLM site.

You can easily fix this by updating the selectors in **`content_script.js`**.

1.  **Open `content_script.js`** in a code editor.
2.  **Find the Selectors:** Use your browser's "Inspect" tool (right-click on the element) to find the new CSS selector for:
    * `NOTES_CONTAINER_SELECTOR`: The main container holding all of your notes.
    * `CITATION_SELECTOR`: The small, clickable citation numbers (e.g., ¬π).
3.  **Update the Variables:** Replace the old selector strings with the new ones you found.
4.  **Reload the Extension:** Go to `chrome://extensions` and click the reload icon on the extension's card.
